To ensure this section is self-contained, we provide the necessary preliminaries and background concepts in the \grayboxtext{gray text boxes}.</p> <p>The section is organized as follows: In Section~\ref{sec:arllm-seqdecmak}, we elaborate on the sequential decision-making nature of auto-regressive LLM generation. In Section~\ref{sec:alignmentasonlinerl}, we discuss the challenge of missing reward signals in LLM alignment and the difficulties associated with current solutions. In Section~\ref{sec:alignmentBC}, we present the perspective that AfD can be formulated as an Inverse RL problem, highlighting the potential solutions from such a perspective.</p> <h3 id="auto-regressive-language-generation-as-sequential-decision-making">Auto-Regressive Language Generation as Sequential Decision Making</h3> <p>\label{sec:arllm-seqdecmak}</p> <p>We first cast auto-regressive language generation into the Markov Decision Processes framework for sequential decision-making.</p> <p>\paragraph{Markov Decision Processes (MDP)} In Markov Decision Processes, decisions are made in discrete time steps and affect the state of the environment in the subsequent step. Formally, an MDP is denoted as \(\mathcal{M} = \{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},\mathcal{T},\mathcal{R},\rho_0,\gamma\}\), where \(\mathcal{S}\subset \mathbb{R}^{d}\) denotes the \(d\)-dim state space, \(\mathcal{A}\) is the action space. Broadly, the environment includes \(\mathcal{T}\) and \(\mathcal{R}\), the former denotes the transition dynamics \(\mathcal{T}: \mathcal{S}\times \mathcal{A} \mapsto \Delta(\mathcal{S})\) that controls transitions between states, and the reward function \(\mathcal{R}:\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\mapsto \mathbb{R}\) provides feedback. \(\rho_0 = p(s_0)\in\Delta(\mathcal{S})\) denotes the initial state distribution. \(\gamma\) is the discount factor that trades off between short-term and long-term returns.</p> <p>In the context of the token-generation process in LLMs, let \(C\) denote the context window size and \(\mathcal{V}\) denote the vocabulary, including the special tokens like \texttt{[EOS]} and \texttt{[MASK]}. The MDP is instantiated as follows: State space \(\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{V}^C\); action space \(\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{V}\); transition dynamics is \textbf{deterministic and known}: \(s' = \mathcal{T}(s,a) = \texttt{Concat}(s,a) = [s, a]\); We consider states containing an \texttt{[EOS]} token as absorbing states, meaning \(\forall a: s' = \mathcal{T}(s,a) = s ~\textrm{if}~ \texttt{[EOS]}\in s\); an LLM \(\ell\), serving as policy \(\pi = \ell\), generates the next token \(a\in\mathcal{A}\) based on the current context \(s\in\mathcal{S}\); The initial state distribution of queries is \(\rho_0\), and \(T\) represents the maximal number of new tokens in a generation. i.e., \(T\) is the maximal number of transitions in the MDP. For instance, in the following case, the context window length \(C\ge7\) and \(T=2\), an initial state \(s_0\) is given as follows:</p> \[\begin{equation} s_0 = \big[\texttt{ The | color | of | the | sky |\hspace{1pt}[MASK]\hspace{1pt}|\hspace{1pt}[MASK]}\big], \end{equation}\] <p>when the language model policy \(\pi\) selects a new token ``\(\texttt{is}\)’’ from the vocabulary \(\mathcal{V}\), the next state deterministically becomes</p> \[\begin{equation} s_1 = \texttt{Concate}(s_0, a_0=\texttt{is})= \big[\texttt{ The | color | of | the | sky | is |\hspace{1pt}[MASK]}\big], \end{equation}\] <p>the generation process continues until either the \texttt{[EOS]} token is selected, the maximal context window size is reached, or the maximal decision steps \(T\) is reached. In this example, the final generated context could be:</p> \[\begin{equation} s_2 = \texttt{Concate}(s_1, a_1=\texttt{blue}) = \big[\texttt{ The | color | of | the | sky | is | blue }\big]. \end{equation}\] <h3 id="challenge-of-the-alignment-mdp-getting-reward-signals-is-hard">Challenge of the Alignment MDP: Getting Reward Signals is Hard</h3> <p>\label{sec:alignmentasonlinerl}</p> <p>The research on LLM alignment focuses on aligning language models with users’ intentions during response generation~\cite{ouyang2022training}. Within the MDP framework, users’ intentions are represented by a reward model \(\mathcal{R}\), which provides feedback on the LLM’s outputs, evaluating aspects such as helpfulness, truthfulness, and harmlessness of the generated content. Typically, evaluations are performed at the trajectory level, meaning feedback is provided only after the entire generation process is complete:</p> \[\begin{equation}\label{eq:base_reward_function} \mathcal{R}(s_t,a_t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} r(s_t) &amp; \text{if } s_t \text{ is a terminal state}, t=T \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{array} \right. \end{equation}\] <p>Ideally, human users would provide feedback for each response, allowing conventional online RL algorithms to optimize the policy \(\pi =\ell\) through</p> \[\begin{equation}\label{eq:online-rl} \pi^* = \arg\max_{\pi\in\Pi}\mathbb{E}_{a_t\sim\pi, s_{t+1}\sim \mathcal{T},s_0\sim \rho_0}\sum_{t=0}^T \gamma^t \mathcal{R}(s_t, a_t) = \arg\max_{\pi\in\Pi}\mathbb{E}_{a_t\sim\pi, s_{t+1}\sim \mathcal{T},s_0\sim \rho_0}r(s_T), \end{equation}\] <p>However, a significant challenge in LLM alignment is \textbf{the difficulty in defining reward signals}, as the desired user intentions are not easily accessible. In prevailing LLM alignment approaches, reward models are typically derived from preference-based annotations.</p> <p>\textbf{Learning Reward Models from Preference Annotations.} Most recent advancements in LLM alignment rely on preference-based datasets of the form \(\mathcal{D}_\mathrm{pref} = \{x_i, y_i^+, y_i^-\}_{i\in[N]}\), where \(y_i^+\) and \(y_i^-\) are the preferred and dis-preferred responses given input \(x_i\). Models such as Bradley-Terry~\cite{bradley1952rank} are then used to convert ranking feedback into absolute scores to serve as reward signals. Thus, we call the reward model built with a preference-based dataset the Bradley-Terry Reward Model (BT-RM). As has been discussed earlier, these datasets pose several challenges, including noisy labels~\cite{azar2023general,zheng2023secrets}, high costs~\cite{guo2024direct,xiong2023gibbs,touvron2023llama,tang2024understanding}, the requirement of additional assumptions in transferring rank to scores~\cite{azar2023general,munos2023nash,bradley1952rank,ethayarajh2024kto,rafailov2023direct}~\footnote{see further analysis in Appendix~\ref{sec:bradley-terry}}, and privacy concerns.</p> <p>% However, despite online feedback can be superior than offline methods, in practice, learning from offline feedback data is still the main stream. % asking human users to provide online feedback scores on language model-generated responses is unrealistic</p> <p>% e.g., the scores may not be consistent and the standard may vary across different users. To circumvent such a difficulty, previous research on LLM alignment primarily focused on the preference-based datasets %The recent advancements of RLHF demonstrate the superiority of using online feedback in alignment~\cite{tang2024understanding}, yet the cost</p> <p>% \paragraph{Offline Preference Data} Another type of data, which is widely studied in the literature, is the preference dataset labeled by human annotators \(\mathcal{D}_\mathrm{pref} = \{x_i, y_i^+, y_i^-\}_{i\in[N]}\). In such a dataset, multiple responses are generated by the LLM policy — rather than experts — and then ranked by annotators. As discussed earlier, challenges for those datasets include noisy labels, high costs, the requirement of additional assumptions in transferring rank to scores, and privacy concerns. % \begin{graybox} % \paragraph{Offline RL} % In the \textit{Offline RL} setting, interactions with the environment are strictly forbidden. The learning problem is no longer online learning but learning from a static dataset of decision logs \(\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{Offline}} = \{(s^i_t,a^i_t,s^i_{t+1},r^i_t)\}\), that is generated by some unknown behavior policy \(\pi_\beta\).</p> <p>% The most obvious difficulty in the offline RL setting is such a setting prohibits exploration — hence it hinders the improvement of policy learning to be improved over the demonstration data. % \end{graybox}</p> <h3 id="alignment-from-demonstrations-an-alternative-to-preference-based-reward-modeling">Alignment from Demonstrations: an Alternative to Preference-based Reward Modeling</h3> <p>\label{sec:alignmentBC}</p> <p>In RL research, learning from human feedback through preference is not the only option when reward signals are unknown or difficult to design~\cite{plappert2018multi}. Learning from a demonstrative behavioral dataset has been widely applied in various domains, including robotics control~\cite{schaal1996learning,nair2018overcoming,hester2018deep}, autonomous driving~\cite{kuderer2015learning,scheel2022urban}, video game playing~\cite{vinyals2019grandmaster}, and AlphaGo~\cite{silver2016mastering}. Formally, with a demonstration dataset containing paired states and high-quality actions: \(\mathcal{D}_\mathrm{demo} = \{s_i, a_i^*\}_{i\in[N]}\), the most direct approach, Behavior Cloning~\cite{pomerleau1991efficient}, learns the policy through supervised learning:</p> <p>\paragraph{Behavior Cloning (BC)} A demonstrative decision dataset is collected from a behavior policy \(\pi_\beta\). Denoting the state-action pairs in the dataset as \((s_i, a^*_i)\), the BC method learns a policy through a supervised learning objective: \(\begin{equation} \pi_\mathrm{BC} = \arg\max_\pi \mathbb{E}_{(s_i,a_i)\sim\mathcal{D}_\mathrm{demo}} \log(\pi(a_i|s_i)) \end{equation}\)</p> <p>\textbf{Supervised Fine Tuning: Behavior Cloning for AfD.} In the context of LLM alignment, demonstrations in the form of \(\mathcal{D}_\mathrm{SFT} = \{x_i, y_i^*\}_{i\in[N]}\) are also referred to as the Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) dataset. This format is versatile: for example, \(x\) can be a general query for Question-Answering tasks, an incomplete sentence for completion tasks, or a general instruction for instruction following tasks; Correspondingly, \(y^*\) represents the desired answers, a completed sentence, or a response following the instruction. % including many private datasets that could not be shared to external human or LLM annotators. Such datasets are widely applied for SFT training, where the learning objective is to minimize the token-wise difference given the existing context. To clarify our notations for further discussion, consider the following example of a context-response pair \(x_i, y^*_i\):</p> \[\begin{equation} \begin{split} x_i &amp;= \big[\texttt{ What | is | the | color | of | the | sky? }\big], \\ y^*_i &amp;= \big[\texttt{ The | color | of | the | sky | is | blue }\big]. \end{split} \end{equation}\] <p>the SFT training first reorganizes the dataset \(\mathcal{D}_\mathrm{SFT}\) to state-action pairs (\(\mathcal{D}_\mathrm{demo}\)) as follows:</p> \[\begin{equation*} \begin{split} s_0 &amp;= \big[\texttt{ What | is | the | color | of | the | sky?~|\hspace{1pt}[MASK]|\hspace{1pt}[MASK]|\hspace{1pt}[MASK]|...}\big], \\ a^*_0 &amp;= \texttt{ The }, \\ s_1 &amp; = \big[\texttt{ What | is | the | color | of | the | sky?~| The |\hspace{1pt}[MASK]\hspace{1pt}|\hspace{1pt}[MASK]|...}\big], \\ a^*_1 &amp;= \texttt{ color } , \\ s_2 &amp; = \big[\texttt{ What | is | the | color | of | the | sky?~| The | color |\hspace{1pt}[MASK]\hspace{1pt}|...}\big], \\ a^*_2 &amp;= \texttt{ of } , \\ &amp;... \end{split} \end{equation*}\] <p>with such a dataset, the learning objective is to reproduce the demonstration token \(a^*_i\) when the LLM (policy) is given \(s_i\) (incomplete token sequences). The training of the SFT is conducted through supervised classification.</p> <p>\textbf{AfD Beyond Supervised Fine Tuning.} While BC is conceptually simple and easy to implement, it faces a fundamental challenge known as the \textit{distributional shift} — during evaluation, the state distribution is generated by rolling out the learned policy \(\pi\), rather than the data-generation behavior policy \(\pi_\beta\). To address this challenge, Imitation Learning (IL) and Inverse RL consider scenarios where the \textit{dynamics model} is available to generate roll-out samples during learning~\cite{pomerleau1991efficient, finn2016guided, abbeel2004apprenticeship}. For a more detailed discussion on the benefits of accessing dynamics models, refer to Appendix~\ref{appdx:extended_preliminary}.</p> <p>% To alleviate such a challenge, Imitation Learning (IL) considers the setting where the \textit{\textbf{dynamics model}} is available to generate roll-out samples during learning~\cite{pomerleau1991efficient,finn2016guided,abbeel2004apprenticeship}. We refer interested readers to Appendix~\ref{appdx:extended_preliminary} for more discussion on the benefits of having access to dynamics models.</p> <p>At first glance, aligning LLMs with an offline demonstration dataset might seem like an offline RL problem, as no further interactions with human annotators are available during training. However, it is the accessibility of online interactions with the \textbf{\textit{dynamics model}}, rather than the reward model, that determines the online or offline nature of the tasks. In LLM alignment practices, while accessing reward models (online annotators) during training is impossible, \textbf{the dynamics model in response generation is known and accessible} — the actions are tokens generated by LLMs, and the responses (trajectories) are concatenations of those generated tokens. This insight naturally leads us to explore alternative approaches rooted in the IL and Inverse RL literature. In Table~\ref{tab:alihan-dan} of Appendix~\ref{appdx:different_RL_approaches}, we contextualize the difference and link between various topics in the RL literature.</p> <p>% With the notations and connections we established above, we now introduce a unified objective class using trajectory distribution matching — a widely studied objective in the IL literature~\cite{jarrett2020strictly,ho2016generative,ghasemipour2020divergence} for the AfD problem.</p> <p>Building on the notations and connections established above, we now introduce a unified objective class using trajectory distribution matching, a widely studied objective in the IL and Inverse RL literature~\cite{jarrett2020strictly, ho2016generative, ghasemipour2020divergence}, for the AfD problem.</p> <h2 id="method">Method</h2> <p>###</p> <p>\section{Algorithms for Alignment from Demonstrations} % : from Behavior Cloning to Adversarial Imitation \label{sec:imitation} % In Section~\ref{sec:alignmentwithimitation}, we present the perspective that LLM alignment can be formulated as an imitation learning problem. % % and introduce practical algorithms that circumvent the requirement of expensive preference data assumed in prevailing LLM alignment literature in Section~\ref{sec:imitation}; <br> % In Section~\ref{sec:imitation}, we introduce practical algorithms that circumvent the need for expensive preference data, which is commonly assumed in the prevailing LLM alignment literature. % % finally, we disclose and solve the potential pitfall of reward (discriminator) modeling in Section~\ref{sec:reward_modeling}. % Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:reward_modeling}, we address and resolve potential pitfalls in reward (discriminator) modeling.</p> <h3 id="alignment-from-demonstration-through-trajectory-distribution-matching">Alignment from Demonstration through Trajectory Distribution Matching</h3> <p>\label{sec:distribution_matching}</p> <p>Unlike the action distribution matching objective used in BC, when the dynamics model is accessible, it is beneficial to study the occupancy matching problem to enhance the performance of learning from the offline demonstrations~\cite{ho2016generative, ross2011reduction, fu2017learning, orsini2021matters}. Specifically, we denote the state-action occupancy measure of the behavior policy (i.e., the demonstrator) as \(\rho^\beta(s,a) = \pi_\beta(a|s)\sum_{t=0}\gamma^t \mathrm{Prob}(s_t = s|\pi_\beta)\), and the state-action occupancy measure of the current policy as \(\rho^\pi(s,a)\). Intuitively, the occupancy measure describes the distribution of state-action pairs visited by an agent under a given policy. For auto-regressive LLMs that take context \(x\) as input and output response \(y = (y^{(0)},y^{(1)},...,y^{(T)}=\texttt{EOS} )\) containing a maximum of \(T+1\) tokens, we have</p> \[\begin{equation} \begin{split} \rho^\pi(s_k,a_k) &amp;= \rho^\pi(s_k = (x,y^{(0:k-1)}),a_k= y^{(k)}) \\ &amp;= \pi(a_k = y^{(k)}| s_k = (x,y^{(0:k-1)}))p(s_{k}) \\ &amp;= \pi(a_k = y^{(k)}| s_k = (x,y^{(0:k-1)})) \pi(a_{k-1} = y^{(k-1)}| s_{k-1} = (x,y^{(0:k-2)})) p(s_{k-1}) \\ &amp;=...\\ &amp;= p(s_0)\Pi^{t=k}_{t=0} \pi(a_t = y^{(t)}| s_t = (x,y^{(0:t-1)})) \end{split} \end{equation}\] <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>In alignment, we are motivated to study the completed generations.

This \textbf{heterogeneity} can introduce significant bias in the reward modeling step, potentially leading to reward hacking~\cite{skalse2022defining, gao2023scaling, zhang2024overcoming, coste2023reward}. The reward model may focus on the heterogeneity of responses — for discrimination — rather than on the informative aspects that truly evaluate the quality of responses in terms of human intention.</p> <p>\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.49\textwidth} \centering \vspace{-0.1cm} \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/rm_fig.png} \vspace{-0.2cm} \caption{\small \textit{Illustration of different choices for positive and negative samples in Inverse-RL reward modeling.} The LLM to be aligned is restricted to a specific model class, limiting its expressivity and capability.

Instead of using the demonstration dataset as positive samples, we use the samples generated by the SFT policy \(\pi_\mathrm{SFT}\), trained on the demonstration dataset, as positive examples. The samples generated by the initial LLM policy \(\pi_0\) serve as negative examples. This approach alleviates the heterogeneity issue that arises when naively combining demonstration samples with \(\pi_0\)-generated samples. Table~\ref{tab:rm_choice} contrasts the different data choices for reward model training. Figure~\ref{fig:RM} visualizes and illustrates their differences. To further explain and contrast different approaches: \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep] \item \textcolor[rgb]{0.9, 0.73, 0.1}{\textbf{Init-Demo RM}}: Using samples generated by \(\pi_0\) as negative examples and demonstration dataset samples as positive examples in reward model training is straightforward. However, as \(\pi_0\) and \(\pi_\beta\) are heterogeneous models, so nuanced differences, such as specific verb usage or response formats in \(\pi_\beta\) can dominate reward model learning rather than the desired alignment properties. \item \textcolor{red}{\textbf{SFT-Demo RM}}: Using samples generated by \(\pi_\mathrm{SFT}\) examples and demonstration dataset samples as positive examples faces the same challenge. Moreover, since \(\pi_\mathrm{SFT}\) and \(\pi_\beta\) are closer in terms of the desired properties to align (scores), reward hacking is even more likely. \item \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Init-SFT RM}}: To avoid potential reward hacking caused by using heterogeneous data in reward model training, we can use samples generated by \(\pi_0\) as negative examples and samples generated by \(\pi_\mathrm{SFT}\) as positive examples. Unlike the previous approaches, where positive and negative examples are generated by heterogeneous models, these two models are homogeneous since the SFT policy is fine-tuned from the initial policy. \item \textbf{Preference-based RM} (BT-RM): In preference-based reward modeling, both preferred and dis-preferred responses are samples from the same LLM~\cite{ouyang2022training}. Therefore, there is no issue of heterogeneity between the positive and negative samples. \end{itemize} When applying the learned reward models at inference time to determine which responses are superior, these responses are generated by \(\pi_\mathrm{SFT}\), therefore, the \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Init-SFT RM}} should outperform other choices.
