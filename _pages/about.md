I am currently a first-year master student at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Tsinghua University</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lx/main.htm">Xiu Li</a>. I received my bachelor's degree with honours from <a href="https://www.sdu.edu.cn/">Shandong University</a> in June 2023. I am now a research intern at <a href="https://www.shlab.org.cn/">Shanghai AI Laboratory</a>, working with Dr. <a href="https://baichenjia.github.io/">Chenjia Bai</a>. Before that, I was a research intern at <a href="https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/">Institute for AI</a> at <a href="https://www.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>, working with Prof. <a href="https://yalidu.github.io/">Yali Du</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.yangyaodong.com/">Yaodong Yang</a>.
